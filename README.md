# Comparative Analysis of GDP Forecasting Models

This project explores and compares the performance of different time-series models for GDP forecasting across BRICS countries using World Bank data (1980â€“2023).

## Models Implemented
- SARIMAX
- LSTM (Deep Learning)
- Hybrid SARIMAX + XGBoost

## Key Findings
The hybrid model consistently outperformed standalone models in accuracy, capturing both trend and nonlinear shocks in GDP time series.

## Project Structure
- `/notebooks`: Code for each model
- `/outputs`: Forecast results and visualizations
